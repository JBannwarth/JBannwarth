## Hello 👋

My name is Jérémie Bannwarth and I am a Control Systems Engineer.

### About me

- ⛴️ I am currently working on fully electric hydrofoiling boats with the crazy talented people at [Seachange](https://goseachange.com/) down in Auckland, New Zealand.
- 🌱 I am currently learning more about fluid mechanics and real analysis by working my way through the [MITx 2.25.3x](https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-fluid-mechanics-3) and [EPFLx - analyse1](https://www.edx.org/course/analyse-i-partie-1) courses on edX. I am also reading through Skogestad and Postlethwaite's [Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Multivariable+Feedback+Control%3A+Analysis+and+Design%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470011676) to improve my control fundamentals. It is a great read, I highly recommend it!
- 😄 My pronouns are he/him.
- 🌎 I am fluent in 🇬🇧 English and 🇫🇷 French and I am working on my 🇯🇵 Japanese.
